        "In recent few years, air traffic number is escalating, according to International Air Transport Association (IATA) forecast, the number of air travellers will reach 7.2 billion in 2035 (Sankararaman, et.al 2017). The increase in air traffic rate is alarming; hence, the air transportation system is focusing on system safety metrics to avoid hazardous incidents.  To facilitate the paradigm of proactive safety, a hybrid predictive model is developed for examination past incidences reports, study associated risk to predict possible occurrences using a probabilistic decision tree. \n",
        "The incident reports were accessed from the database of the Aviation Safety Reporting System; the heterogeneity of data was reduced by dividing the dataset into structured and unstructured dataset. As a result, Support Vector Machine (SVM) model could identify the relationship between event summary and risk factor of incident consequences (unstructured data), parallel to this Deep Neural Network (DNN) model was trained with the association between incident features and outcomes (structured data).\n",
        "The hybrid model (Woźniak 2014) is a four-step process, consisting of the SVM model and Ensemble DNN model to predict event risk as well as event level outcome. The effectiveness and performance of the hybrid model were measured by comparing it against three different individual models, statistical tests and a ten-fold cross-validation process. The objective of the developed hybrid model was achieved by the prevailing individual model's accuracy features like recall, precision and F1 score (Zhang & Mahadevan 2019). \n",

        " (Zhang & Mahadevan 2019) The air transportation system is developing safety metrics by committing countless efforts to assess the risk and safety associated with one or many subsystems like flight tracking, airport ground operations, and runway system. According to the study, the two prime strategies which can strengthen the safety of the air transportation system are:\n",
        "1.\tReducing the probability of system malfunction and operator foul-ups to enhance system reliability.\n",
        "2.\tIncrease in operator’s receptiveness. \n",
        "With respect to this, the tremendous comprehensive study to intensify air transportation safety outlines the identification of accidental precursors and prevention of future accidents by undertaking appropriate measures, which relies on the first strategy.\n",
        "However, the air transportation system is distributed human-system interaction and involves various interlinked networks of operators, technical team and stakeholders.\n",
        "Apart from investigating accidents induced by human factors, the system reliability can be improved by reinforcing the operator's capabilities and efficiency with better decision making in response to hazardous events, thus mitigating the severity of accidents. In that context, unlike other methodologies, the proposed method aligns with second strategy improving aviation and system reliability by appropriate prediction of consequences of abnormal events w.r.t. Risk levels. This goal was accomplished in four steps: \n",
        "1.\tCategorizing all events based on risk level into groups – low, moderately medium, medium, moderately high, high which are linked with event consequences. \n",
        "2.\tDeveloping the SVM model to discover an association between event summary (textual form) and event consequence. Along with this, an ensemble of trained DNN establishes a complicated association linking incident features and outcomes. \n",
        "3.\tDeveloping unique fusion rule to combine predictions resulted from two different trained ML models, therefore raising prediction quality.\n",
        "4.\tAt last, a probabilistic decision tree is used to encompass event-level probabilities along with categorized risks level records.\n",
        "The accident reports were delivered by pilots, technicians, aviation controllers and other authoritative crew to Aviation Safety Reporting System (ASRS), it was a challenge to create a model from ASRS information, the challenges faced were: \n",
        "1.\tHigh-dimensional data: Every report consisted of 50 plus attributes like weather, flight phase, flight conditions, visibility, etc., making it hard for ML algorithms to gain accurate prediction. \n",
        "2.\tOverall Categorical data: An attribute (crew size) was integer, 99% of data were categorical, as categorical features are more descriptive and less informative it was hard to blend the outcomes and maintain model performance.\n",
        "3.\tUnstructured data: Mining casual relationships from textual data like event synopsis, was performed by converting it into numerical data, further serving its term frequency to the SVM model.  \n",
        "4.\tImbalance class distribution: Figure below represents the records (possible outcomes) are highly imbalanced across different classes. In the data reported by ASRS, records in one class were significantly larger than other.\n",

Secondly, the class distribution is highly imbalanced, and lastly, one abnormal event can result in multiple outcomes.

It discovered the relation among event summary and risk associated with incident outcome by working on unstructured data. The TF-IDF vector (Term Frequency – Inverse Document Frequency) is fed to the SVM model to recognize the hyperplane which distinguishes various classes (Lilleberg, et.al 2015). \n",

This fusion strategy could resolve the disagreed predictions as no model is perfect; the valuable information from misclassification and erroneous predictions were used to correct model prediction. In consideration with three factors like Record-level prediction probabilities, Relation of each class record with dissimilar predictions and Class-level accuracy, the fusion rule could successfully assign test record with the highest probability (likelihood) to class as an output (Zhang & Mahadevan 2019).\n",

This study can further assist risk advisory to configure priorities, resource distribution and risk quantification to enhance safety paradigm. The technical quality of this research paper is high, all four stages of the proposed model processes in an appropriate way and overcome challenges to gain accurate prediction. The performance of the model is captured using three different performance metrics, namely precision, recall and F1 score. The authors supported their proposed framework by making several contributions like developing risk-based event outcome, making best use of erroneous results of SVM and DNN model through fusion rule. The results were further mapped into a decision tree to represent the outcome. \n",
        " The figure below shows performance metrics for SVM and DNN models, and true labels are the five categorized risk factors. A support column is a number of occurrences in each class, a consistent prediction column is a number of predictions which were constant for two models, and lastly, the consistent prediction accuracy is the proportional rate of records which were correctly labelled inconsistent model predictions. The success of the model was validated after comparing its performance with ordinal logistic regression (OLR); the hybrid model had the best prediction potential of making it the best choice (Pedregosa 2015). \n",

The model was derived on a testing data set to observe and gain insights about its appropriateness and no scope of improvement. Initially, the 91,872 records were split into three sets: training (85%), validation (5%), and testing (10%). The SVM estimator optimized hyperparameters and performance metrics were obtained through validation dataset. In the DNN model, ten different neural networks were trained, and performance metrics were obtained by testing an ensemble of those networks with the validation set.    \n",
